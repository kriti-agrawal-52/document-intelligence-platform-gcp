# Deployment Issues Analysis

This document categorizes the issues encountered during the initial deployment and explains how they were resolved.

## üîç **Issue Categories**

### 1. **Infrastructure & Deployment Issues** (Fixed in `deploy.sh`)

These are issues related to the deployment process itself, not the application code.

| Issue                                 | Description                                                | Fix Location | Solution                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Missing Terraform Steps**           | Original script assumed infrastructure existed             | `deploy.sh`  | Added `terraform init`, `plan`, `apply` steps      |
| **External Secrets Operator Missing** | ESO not installed before trying to use ExternalSecrets     | `deploy.sh`  | Added Helm installation of ESO                     |
| **Database Placeholder Mismatch**     | Sed patterns didn't match actual comment text in manifests | `deploy.sh`  | Fixed sed patterns to match exact placeholder text |
| **Missing Database Creation**         | `auth_db` database didn't exist in MySQL                   | `deploy.sh`  | Added MySQL database creation step                 |
| **Missing OPENAI_API_KEY in Auth**    | Environment variable not configured in auth deployment     | `deploy.sh`  | Added env var to auth deployment manifest          |
| **External Secrets API Version**      | Using deprecated v1beta1 instead of v1                     | `deploy.sh`  | Updated API version in manifests                   |

### 2. **Code Defects** (Fixed in Source Code)

These were actual bugs in the application code that needed permanent fixes.

| Issue                       | Description                                         | Fix Location                          | Solution                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Missing `import os`**     | Text extraction service used `os` without importing | `text_extraction_service/main.py`     | Added `import os`                             |
| **Lifespan Function Order** | FastAPI app used `lifespan` before it was defined   | `text_extraction_service/main.py`     | Moved function definition before usage        |
| **Missing Redis Env Vars**  | Shared config didn't include REDIS_HOST/PORT        | `shared/config.py`                    | Added Redis environment variables             |
| **MongoDB SSL Config**      | Text extraction used strict SSL validation          | `text_extraction_service/database.py` | Changed to `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=True` |

## üìã **Original vs Fixed Deployment Script**

### **What the Original Script Did Wrong:**

1. **‚ùå Assumed Infrastructure Existed**

   - Started with `terraform output` without ensuring infrastructure was deployed
   - No error handling if Terraform state didn't exist

2. **‚ùå Missing External Secrets Setup**

   - Applied ExternalSecret resources without installing the operator
   - No ClusterSecretStore configuration

3. **‚ùå Incorrect Sed Patterns**

   - Database placeholder replacements failed due to pattern mismatch
   - Hardcoded patterns that didn't match actual manifest comments

4. **‚ùå No Database Initialization**

   - Assumed `auth_db` database existed in MySQL
   - No provision for creating application databases

5. **‚ùå Missing Environment Variables**
   - Auth service missing OPENAI_API_KEY
   - External Secrets using wrong API version

### **What the Fixed Script Does Right:**

1. **‚úÖ Complete Infrastructure Provisioning**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
   ```

2. **‚úÖ External Secrets Operator Setup**

   ```bash
   helm install external-secrets external-secrets/external-secrets
   kubectl create secret generic aws-credentials
   kubectl apply -f cluster-secret-store.yaml
   ```

3. **‚úÖ Correct Manifest Templating**

   ```bash
   sed "s|externalName: # <--- REPLACE with your RDS endpoint|externalName: ${RDS_ENDPOINT}|g"
   ```

4. **‚úÖ Database Creation**

   ```bash
   create_mysql_database "auth_db"
   ```

5. **‚úÖ Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Prerequisites checking
   - Command logging
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Timeout handling

## üéØ **Key Learnings**

### **Why Code Fixes Shouldn't Be in Deployment Scripts:**

1. **üîß Code defects are permanent fixes** - Once fixed, they don't need to be applied again
2. **üì¶ Deployment scripts should be idempotent** - Running multiple times shouldn't change the source code
3. **üöÄ CI/CD best practices** - Code fixes belong in the source repository, not deployment automation
4. **üîÑ Maintainability** - Deployment scripts become complex and error-prone when mixing code fixes

### **Deployment Script Best Practices:**

1. **üõ°Ô∏è Infrastructure First** - Always ensure infrastructure exists before deploying applications
2. **üìã Prerequisites Validation** - Check all required tools and credentials upfront
3. **üîó Dependency Management** - Install operators and dependencies before using them
4. **üìù Comprehensive Logging** - Log all commands and outputs for debugging
5. **‚è±Ô∏è Wait Strategies** - Include proper wait times for asynchronous operations
6. **üßπ Cleanup** - Remove temporary files and resources after deployment

## üöÄ **Final Result**

The fixed deployment script now:

- ‚úÖ **Deploys infrastructure from scratch** using Terraform
- ‚úÖ **Handles all dependencies** (External Secrets Operator, databases)
- ‚úÖ **Creates all required resources** (namespaces, secrets, databases)
- ‚úÖ **Validates deployment success** with health checks
- ‚úÖ **Provides comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ **Works reliably** without manual intervention

The script is now truly automated and can deploy the entire Document Intelligence microservices stack from a clean AWS account with just one command: `./deploy.sh`

# 🔒 Frontend Security & Architecture Deep Dive

This document addresses the security model, regional configuration, caching behavior, and backup strategy for the Document Intelligence frontend deployment.

## 🔐 **Security Architecture**

### **S3 Bucket Security Model**

#### ❌ **MISCONCEPTION: "S3 Bucket is Public"**

**REALITY: The S3 bucket is PRIVATE and SECURE**

```hcl
# S3 bucket blocks ALL public access
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "frontend_pab" {
  block_public_acls       = true   # ✅ Block public ACLs
  block_public_policy     = true   # ✅ Block public bucket policies
  ignore_public_acls      = true   # ✅ Ignore existing public ACLs
  restrict_public_buckets = true   # ✅ Restrict public bucket policies
}
```

#### 🛡️ **Access Control Flow**

```
Internet User → CloudFront Edge → Origin Access Control (OAC) → Private S3 Bucket
                    ↓
               Cache Hit? → Serve from Edge Cache (No S3 access needed)
                    ↓
               Cache Miss? → Fetch from S3 using OAC credentials
```

#### 🔑 **Origin Access Control (OAC)**

- **Modern AWS Security**: Replaces legacy Origin Access Identity (OAI)
- **Signed Requests**: All S3 requests are cryptographically signed
- **No IAM Users**: No access keys or credentials stored anywhere
- **Service Principal**: Uses AWS service-to-service authentication

```hcl
# Only CloudFront service can access S3
policy = {
  Principal = {
    Service = "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"  # Only AWS CloudFront service
  }
  Condition = {
    StringEquals = {
      "AWS:SourceArn" = aws_cloudfront_distribution.frontend_distribution.arn
    }
  }
}
```

### **Multi-Layer Security**

#### 1. **Network Level**

- ✅ **HTTPS Only**: HTTP automatically redirects to HTTPS
- ✅ **TLS 1.2+**: Modern encryption protocols only
- ✅ **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3**: Latest performance protocols

#### 2. **Application Level**

- ✅ **Security Headers**: XSS, clickjacking, content-type protection
- ✅ **No Direct S3 Access**: Impossible to bypass CloudFront
- ✅ **Signed URLs**: All S3 requests authenticated

#### 3. **Data Level**

- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: S3 server-side encryption (AES256)
- ✅ **Encryption in Transit**: TLS for all connections
- ✅ **Versioning**: File history for backup/recovery

---

## 🌍 **Regional Architecture**

### **S3 Bucket Location**

```hcl
# S3 bucket is created in YOUR chosen region (ap-south-1 by default)
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "frontend_bucket" {
  bucket = "your-app-frontend-xyz123"
  # Created in: ap-south-1 (Mumbai, India)
}
```

**Why This Region?**

- ✅ **Same as Backend**: Reduces latency for deployments
- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: No cross-region data transfer charges
- ✅ **Compliance**: Data residency requirements met

### **CloudFront Edge Locations**

#### **Price Class Configuration**

```hcl
price_class = "PriceClass_200"  # US, Canada, Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa
```

**Available Options:**

- **PriceClass_All**: All 400+ edge locations worldwide (highest cost)
- **PriceClass_200**: ~200 locations covering major regions (balanced)
- **PriceClass_100**: ~100 locations in US, Canada, Europe (lowest cost)

#### **Edge Locations Included (PriceClass_200)**

```
🌍 Global Coverage:
├── 🇺🇸 North America: 50+ locations
├── 🇪🇺 Europe: 40+ locations
├── 🇦🇺 Asia Pacific: 30+ locations
├── 🇿🇦 Africa: 5+ locations
├── 🇸🇦 Middle East: 5+ locations
└── 🇧🇷 South America: 10+ locations

Total: ~200 edge locations
```

#### **Performance by Region**

| User Location | Nearest Edge | Typical Latency |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Mumbai, India | Mumbai       | <10ms           |
| Singapore     | Singapore    | <20ms           |
| London, UK    | London       | <15ms           |
| New York, US  | New York     | <10ms           |
| Tokyo, Japan  | Tokyo        | <15ms           |

## ⏰ **Caching Behavior Deep Dive**

### **Cache Duration Strategy**

#### 🎯 **Static Assets (/\_next/static/)**

```hcl
min_ttl     = 31536000  # 1 year
default_ttl = 31536000  # 1 year
max_ttl     = 31536000  # 1 year
```

**Why 1 Year?**

- ✅ **Immutable**: Next.js adds content hash to filenames
- ✅ **Never Changes**: `app.a1b2c3.js` never changes content
- ✅ **Maximum Performance**: Served from edge cache, never hits S3

#### 📄 **HTML Files (index.html, 404.html)**

```hcl
min_ttl     = 0        # No minimum
default_ttl = 3600     # 1 hour
max_ttl     = 31536000 # 1 year maximum
```

**Why 1 Hour?**

- ✅ **Fast Updates**: New deployments visible within 1 hour
- ✅ **Good Performance**: Most users get cached version
- ✅ **Instant Invalidation**: Can force immediate updates if needed

#### 🚫 **API Calls (/api/)**

```hcl
min_ttl     = 0  # Never cache
default_ttl = 0  # Never cache
max_ttl     = 0  # Never cache
```

**Why No Caching?**

- ✅ **Dynamic Content**: API responses change frequently
- ✅ **User-Specific**: Each user gets personalized data
- ✅ **Security**: Authentication tokens shouldn't be cached

### **Cache Invalidation Process**

#### **Automatic Invalidation on Deploy**

```python
# deployment script automatically invalidates cache
response = cloudfront_client.create_invalidation(
    DistributionId=distribution_id,
    InvalidationBatch={
        'Paths': {
            'Items': ['/*']  # Invalidate everything
        }
    }
)
```

#### **Invalidation Timeline**

```
Deploy → Upload to S3 → Create Invalidation → Wait for Completion → Users See Changes
  ↓           ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓
 0min       2min           2min               5-15min             15min
```

## 💾 **Backup & Recovery Strategy**

### **S3 Versioning**

```hcl
versioning_configuration {
  status = "Enabled"  # Keep multiple versions of each file
}
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Deployment History**: Every deployment creates new versions
- ✅ **Rollback Capability**: Can restore any previous version
- ✅ **Accidental Deletion Protection**: Files never truly deleted

### **Lifecycle Management**

```hcl
rule {
  # Current version lifecycle
  expiration {
    days = 90  # Delete current files after 90 days
  }

  # Previous versions lifecycle
  noncurrent_version_expiration {
    noncurrent_days = 30  # Keep old versions for 30 days
  }

  # Cost optimization
  noncurrent_version_transition {
    noncurrent_days = 7      # After 7 days
    storage_class   = "STANDARD_IA"  # Move to cheaper storage
  }
}
```

### **Backup Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Bad Deployment**

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket your-bucket --prefix index.html
aws s3api get-object --bucket your-bucket --key index.html --version-id PREVIOUS_VERSION

# Or redeploy previous git commit
git checkout HEAD~1
./deploy-frontend.sh
```

#### **Scenario 2: Accidental File Deletion**

```bash
# Restore deleted file from version history
aws s3api restore-object --bucket your-bucket --key deleted-file.js --version-id VERSION_ID
```

#### **Scenario 3: Complete Infrastructure Loss**

```bash
# Infrastructure as Code restoration
terraform apply  # Recreates all infrastructure
./deploy-frontend.sh  # Redeploys latest frontend from git
```

### **Cross-Region Backup (Optional)**

```hcl
# Optional: Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
resource "aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration" "frontend_backup" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.frontend_bucket.id

  rule {
    id     = "ReplicateToSecondaryRegion"
    status = "Enabled"

    destination {
      bucket        = aws_s3_bucket.frontend_backup.arn
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚫 **What You DON'T Need**

### **IAM Roles for Frontend-Backend Communication**

```
❌ MISCONCEPTION: Frontend needs IAM roles to call backend APIs
✅ REALITY: Frontend uses JWT tokens for API authentication

Flow:
Frontend (Browser) → API Gateway/ALB → Backend Services
     ↓
  JWT Token in Authorization Header (not AWS credentials)
```

### **CORS Configuration on S3**

```
❌ MISCONCEPTION: S3 needs CORS for frontend
✅ REALITY: CloudFront serves the frontend, no direct S3 access

Flow:
User Browser → CloudFront Edge → S3 (no direct browser-to-S3 requests)
```

### **Public S3 Bucket**

```
❌ MISCONCEPTION: S3 bucket must be public for web hosting
✅ REALITY: CloudFront accesses private S3 bucket via OAC

Security:
Private S3 ← OAC ← CloudFront ← HTTPS ← User Browser
```

---

## 🔍 **Security Validation Commands**

### **Verify S3 Bucket is Private**

```bash
# This should return "Access Denied"
curl -I https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

# This should work (via CloudFront)
curl -I https://your-cloudfront-domain.net/index.html
```

### **Check Bucket Policy**

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name
# Should show CloudFront-only access policy
```

### **Verify Encryption**

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket your-bucket-name
# Should show AES256 encryption enabled
```

### **Check Public Access Block**

```bash
aws s3api get-public-access-block --bucket your-bucket-name
# All should be "true" (blocked)
```

## 💰 **Cost Breakdown by Region**

### **Data Transfer Costs**

```
S3 (ap-south-1) → CloudFront: $0.00/GB (free)
CloudFront → Users: $0.01-0.12/GB (varies by region)

Example monthly costs:
├── 10GB to Asia users: $0.80
├── 10GB to US users: $0.85
├── 10GB to Europe users: $0.85
└── 10GB to other regions: $1.20
```

### **Request Costs**

```
CloudFront Requests:
├── First 1B requests/month: $0.0075 per 10K
├── Next 9B requests/month: $0.0070 per 10K
└── Over 10B requests/month: $0.0065 per 10K

S3 Requests (only on cache miss):
├── GET requests: $0.0004 per 1K
└── PUT requests: $0.005 per 1K
```

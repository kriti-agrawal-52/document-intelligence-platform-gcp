# =============================================================================
# USER IMAGES STORAGE - GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE BUCKET FOR UPLOADED DOCUMENTS
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE: Store user-uploaded images (documents) securely with metadata
# SECURITY: Private bucket with proper IAM access controls
# METADATA: Each image includes user_id and image_name for tracking
# ARCHITECTURE: Images stored in GCS â†’ Firestore references GCS URLs
#
# STORAGE PATTERN:
# /user-images/{user_id}/{image_name}_{timestamp}.{extension}
# EXAMPLE: /user-images/123/document_20241201_143022.jpg
